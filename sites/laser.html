		<h1> The Laser </h1>
		<h2> Date </h2>
		<p> The first foundations for the creation of the laser were discovered by Albert Einstein in 1917. In 1959 Gordon Gould of Columbia University hypothesizes the idea of ​​the possibility of using the stimulated emission to amplify light with an optical resonator capable of creating a narrow beam of coherent light, which defines LASER, an acronym for "Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation ". </p>
		<h2> Use </h2>
		<p> The laser was used for cutting precious gems and also for military uses. nowadays the laser is used for many things and in many fields, for example in the field of medicine, or in printers, cutting materials and much more. </p>

		<h2> Dimensions </h2>
		<p> They include different types of lasers for various uses and their sizes. <br>They include the type of use that is made, they can be very small or larger as for cutting stones. </p>
		<h2> How it works </h2>
		<p> Light particles (photons) excited by the current release energy in the form of light. <br>This light is directed in a beam. This forms the laser beam. </p>
